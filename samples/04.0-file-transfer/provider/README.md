## Who am I

This is BMW that is providing an offer and detailed information about its car.

There are different parts and the parts can present different information based on who is consuming the data. 

For example, the end customer of my vehicle should know that the motor cover is blue, shiny, but they should not know the material requirements. They can get a price for a nicer motor cover that is e.g. even more shiny.

Similarly, a competitor should not have access to material requirements or CAD data and they can never see the price. Thus, a competitor has even less access.

On the other hand, manufacturers in europe can have access to all the information they need to send an offer and eventually to produce the part.
